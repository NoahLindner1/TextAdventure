<h2>Simulations<h2>
<p>The simulations are each contained in their own folder. They all follow the same format, starting at the head followed by two options that lead to a series of two more options and a final result page. Each page of the simulation is made up of a prompt at the top, and two responses(one on each half of the page) followed by a button directly under. The final result page contains some closing text and a button to restart the simulation so the user can experience different paths and results. Also, the name of the person is listed at the top of the head page.<p>
